## Project Overview :page_facing_up:
### Overview
Secure simple decentralized crypto payments gateway.<br/>
The merchant must provide a valid DOT address when generating merchant ID in order to receive DOT payments (the only thing required).<br/>
The team interesting developing this project to redefine the online payments by using the crypto wallet instead credit cards.

### Project Details
#### Architecture
![](https://cryptocheckout.co/archi.jpg)
#### Tech stack
This project uses apache as web server (it can be nginx), php & javascript for the front & the back ends, nosql db to store useful data such as merchants, transactions, bayer details
#### Documentation
Accepting crypto payments with CryptoCheckout does not require specific tech stack.<br/>
The merchant must insert valid DOT address & generate merchant ID from the home page (no signup required).<br/>
Include our script on the page where the products/services are, providing his merchant ID on the link eg:
   
    <script src="https://cryptocheckout.co/crypto.js&id=fa8b" ></script>

Initialize the "Pay with CryptoCheckout" button

    showbtn('MycontainerdivID',{usd:1},onApprove=function(transactionId){//Do something},onError=function(error){//Do something});
    
Handle the server side payment validation, by using this endpoint to get transaction details:<br/>
https://cryptocheckout.co/?transaction=transactionId, the transactionId is retreived from the onApprove(transactionId) event, eg in case using php: <br/>

    <?php
    if( isset($_GET['transactionId'] ){
        $transaction_object = json_decode(file_get_contents('https://cryptocheckout.co/?transaction='.$_GET['transactionId']));
        if( abs(floatval($product_price)*floatval($transaction_object->rate)-floatval($transaction_object->amount))<=0.000001 && $transaction_object->completed == true && !in_array($_GET['transactionId'],$transactions_list) ){
            blacklist_transaction($_GET['transactionId']);
            // generate orderId
            $orderId = md5(strval(round(microtime(true)*1000)));
            header('Content-type: application/json');
            echo json_encode(array('result'=>true,'msg'=>'Thank you for your purchase!','orderId'=>$orderId));
            die();
        }else{
            header('Content-type: application/json');
            echo json_encode(array('result'=>false,'msg'=>'We can\'t validate your payment'));
            die();
        }
    }else{
        header('Content-type: application/json');
        echo json_encode(array('result'=>false,'msg'=>'transactionId is required'));
        die();
    }
    
#### The MVP
The product demo (Pay with CryptoCheckout's button) available within the homepage for both users (desktop & mobile):<br/> https://cryptocheckout.co<br/>
#### Limitation(s)
This project does not provide UI for the merchant's transactions history or sending funds, the merchant should use the platform/app where the provided address is generated.<br/>

### Ecosystem Fit
- The project fit the ecosystem in its main coin (DOT), more specific in its transactions, simply by confirm such amount were sent from such buyer to such seller.<br/>
- The target audiance is any person has DOT address/wallet, it could be as a merchant has online business want to accept DOT, or naturel user want to pay using his DOT balance.<br/>
- This project meet these needs:
    - How to exploit the large maket ($2.28T), serve the large uaer base (at least 500M).
    - New online payments solution with reduced transaction fee.
    - Financial technology with high security levels, with more freedom (decentralized) & confidential.
- The previous needs identified within:
    - Scientific article: https://journals2.ums.ac.id/laj/article/download/743/480/5791, Cryptocurrencies as Digital Payment Media: Opportunities 
and Challenges, Denny & Hari Sutra Disemadi, Universitas Muhammadiyah Surakarta, Feb 2023 (the page 7/15)
    - Case study: https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/audit/us-corporates-using-crypto-pov.pdf, The Business Benefit of Using Cryptocurrency, Deloitte US (the pages 3/16, 4/16)

- There are no projects like this in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem.
    - The reasons that does not make it happens, successful or attempted are:
        - Risky step (creating the saas is complexe & require much work & time without garanteed results).
        - A time issue (which will be available next few months).
          
- There are many projects like this in related ecosystems.

## Development Status :open_book:

The repo of the whole CryptoCheckout's project: https://github.com/BenraouaneSoufiane/cryptocheckout.co/tree/main/site

Built with php (without any framework) & jQuery, uses nosql bds for performance issues (located in the db directory)
- index.php constract the main page & contain the core functionalities, includes all the api requests (generating new merchant id, handling the script inclusion call, validating the payments,...).
- Folders with crypto currencies symbols contain the qr images for each transaction.
- Other folders contain the main index.php file of each page.
  
- Documentation: the source code is in the app.js file, within the api folder.
    - At the initial release, where the wallet were generated on the site when the merchant hit generate merchant ID ([changelog](https://cryptocheckout.co/changelog)), this project used the official js packages for each crypto currency to implement the basic operations like generating wallets, creating, signing & submitting transaction fellowing the official documentation for each crypto currency. Below are examples but not limited:
        - For Polkadot, this project used @polkadot/api package: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@polkadot/api fellowing this documentation: https://polkadot.js.org/docs/ui-keyring/start/install.
    - After the update, this project ignore the previous packages when generating & importing the wallet to be used for the transactions, to match the addresses with the TrustWallet & Metamask apps/extensions, it used the official TrustWallet package:
        - https://www.npmjs.com/package/@trustwallet/wallet-core, fellowing this official doc: https://developer.trustwallet.com/developer/wallet-core/integration-guide/wallet-core-usage.
        -  The last update ignore all that previous development, for privacy issue, (the merchant prefer to not generate their wallet with CryptoCheckout, so we enable the merchant accept DOT by sharing only their addresses), the previous updates are DEPREACATED now.
## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/Support%20Docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe *the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible*, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Substrate, Kusama or Polkadot. We *recommend* that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone â‰ˆ 1 month.

> :exclamation: If any of your deliverables are based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish *under the terms of the license* of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Projects that submit other people's work without proper attribution will be immediately terminated.**
